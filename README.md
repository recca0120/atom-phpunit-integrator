## php-unit-integrator package

Integrates the phpunit testing system into the atom text editor.

This is in beta mode at the moment. I would appreciate any testers and feedback.
I could also use some help with writing mocha tests for this package.

#### Features:
1. Point and click interface
1. Code Coverage highlighting
1. Test Suite/Case generation (requires php-integrator)

#### Background
After switching to atom, I missed the phpunit integration within the netbeans
editor. This is an attempt at creating a similar environment.
